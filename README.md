# Voice Veritas: Truth in Voices 🎙

##  Overview
Voice Veritas is a real-time audio authentication system designed to detect deepfake voices using machine learning. It uses MFCC feature extraction, an AdaBoost classification model, and live audio analysis to identify and flag synthetic voices. This project emphasizes security, fraud detection, and ethical AI.

##  Features
- Real-time voice input and classification
- MFCC-based audio feature extraction
- AdaBoost ML model for deepfake detection
- Voice-based feedback using speech recognition
